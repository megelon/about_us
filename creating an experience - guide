How can we build a skill challenge/program?

1. Define which skill do you want to be learned. 
2. Learn about the skill as much as you can!
3. Ideate how can a person learn this skill in a fun way! Think in videogame-mode! Remember we are in a community full of people who can help you design a great experience!
4. Start building the challenge with a small explanation of how to develop the skill. 
5. Then, explain what is the challenge about. 
6. While the challenges get harder, share tips and content for developing the skill. 
7. Try always to have a fun UX! We all love to have great experiences!

Our goal: to have fun while learning.
