Experiment

What is the experiment about?
To start the learning content in our open-source platform, we wanted to start by developing the skill of "problem solving".
This is a huge skill. Therefore, we will start from a very beginning. Then, we'll continue developing the skill through programming. 
This experiment aims to build a videogame to develop the skill. 
The videogame will be built in Python. 

Team:
Main developer: Paula Fuentes
Designer: Andrea Jaramillo ¿?

Measurement:
As this is our first experiment and MVP, the aim is not to develop notably a skill, but start contacting the users and learning from their experience.
Therefore, we will measure the experiment by asking satisfaction questions as:
