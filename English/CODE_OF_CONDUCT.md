# MARAKA: Code of Conduct

We, as part of MARAKA, want to promote an open and inclusive community, so we are committed to ensure a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

## How it works

Examples of behaviour that promote a positive environment:

* Active listening
* Be kind to others
* Respect different points of view or experiences
* Accept constructive critic
* Focus on what is better for the community
* Show empathy

Examples of non-acceptable behaviour:

* Offensive comments
* Comments that reinforce social dominance structures
* Sexual images in public spaces without previous consent
* Stalking or intimidating
* Taking pictures or recording without consent
* Interrupting continuosly
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Undesired sexual attention
* Promote any of the above


## Our responsibilities

The project administrators are responsible for communicating standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take corrective and appropriate action in response to situations of unacceptable behavior.

The project administrators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, documentation issues, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporary or permanently any collaborator whose behavior is inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.
