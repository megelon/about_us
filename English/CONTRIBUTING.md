## How can I contribute?

GWP is organised in two main sub-projects:

* philosophy (repo link)
* tech platform (repo link)

Each sub-project contains tasks or *issues*, categorised in:

* To-do
* In-progress
* Done

### Beginner's taks

If this is your first time collaborating in a project, we suggest you find a concrete initial task to contribute with :wink:

1. Choose a sub-project, go to the repo
2. Go to the Issues tab
3. Search for issues labeled *'good first issue'*

Once you detect an issue to work on, leave a comment on it with your contribution.

### Pending tasks

To take a look at pending stuff:

1. Choose a sub-project, go to the repo
2. Go to the project tab
3. Check issues listed under "to do" panel

Once you detect an issue to work on, leave a comment on it with your contribution. 

### Suggesting enhancements

If you see anything that can be enhanced (text, code, translations, anything) just [create an *issue*](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and if you're familiar with GitHub, propose a change and create a pull request.
